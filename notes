#### Abnormalities:

- negative prices
- negative quantities
- null and duplicate values
- The price varies for the same stockCode

#### Assumptions:

- The provided price is a unit price
- assumed that StockCode should be num+uppercase characters
- The price varies for the same stock 
- Assumed that the price does not only depend on the stockcode
- The same invoice can include multiple items


#### Proposed aggregations:


# TOP 20 revenue by product

SELECT TOP 20  SUM(f.total_price) as total_sales, SUM(f.quantity) as total_quantity, s.stockcode, s.description
FROM invoices_f f
JOIN Stock_d s on f.stockcode_key = s.stockcode_key
GROUP BY s.stockcode, s.description 
ORDER BY total_sales DESC


# Total Sales by month

SELECT d.month, SUM(f.total_price) AS total_sales
FROM invoices_f f
JOIN Date_d d ON d.invoicedate_key = f.invoicedate_key
GROUP BY d.month
ORDER BY total_sales desc

# Customer count by country

SELECT count(f.customer_key) customer_count, ctr.country from invoices_f f
JOIN Country_d ctr ON f.country_key = ctr.country_key 
JOIN Customer_d c ON f.customer_key = c.customer_key
GROUP BY ctr.country
ORDER by customer_count desc
